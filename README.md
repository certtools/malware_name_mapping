Malware Name Mapping
====================

There are a lot of different malware names used in the IT security community for the same kind of malware.
This repository holds regular expression to match those and derive a commonly used malware *family* name.

This mapping is used in reporting (as generic name) and for statistics purpose.

This mapping can be used in **IntelMQ**, see the tools provided by intelmq in contrib/: https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/tree/maintenance/contrib/malware_name_mapping
The IntelMQ integration can also import the threat actors available in the MISP Galaxies.

Format
------

Currently it is comma-separated. The meaning of the columns is:

 1. regular expression, starting with `^` and ending with `$`. It can/should be applied case-insensitive. The field is encapsulated in double quotes (`"`).
 2. malware family name
 3. optional comment (origin of the rule, where the malware names occur etc)

Tools
-----

### Lookup

```bash
> ./scripts/tools.py lookup b66-ir
Found match 'b66-ir' -> 'andromeda'.
```

Tests
-----

To check the validity of the file, you can run `./scripts/test.py`. It checks if

  * all lines do match the format,
  * there are not family matching to other family names and
  * that each family names is matched to itself.

`mapping.csv` and everything else: CC0-1.0
`malpedia.csv`: CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0. The usage of this data is optional in tools and integration.

### Malpedia integration

Malpedia provides an inventory of malware including known alternative names. This data can optionally by used to supplement the existing mapping.
The `mapping.csv` also contains some *references* to malpedia, which does not necessarily mean, that the data is from there.
